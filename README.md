# 🧠 Quiz Result Saver

## 🧩 Description

A simple **Java console application** that allows users to take a 5-question multiple-choice quiz and save their results to a text file using **file writing**.  
It demonstrates how to handle **file I/O** operations in Java, including safely writing data and managing exceptions with `try-with-resources`.  
The program records each user’s name and score in a `results.txt` file, ensuring results are saved even if the program restarts.
